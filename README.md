This is the repository for the paper DenseBAM-GI: Attention Augmented DeneseNet with momentum aided GRU for HMER.  The inference code is driver_code_inference.py which will call Densenet_testway_BAM_GI_inference.py. The model scores 51 percent exprate on CROHME 2014 dataset. 
For traning one should use the file test_momentum_training_and_testing_accuracy.py
